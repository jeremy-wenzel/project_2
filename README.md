### How to Play the game

The game, currently, isn't in a playable state because the Paddle hasn't been fully implemented. You can attempt to move forward using the "W" key but it is really buggy. You can also try to move the orientation of the paddle with the mouse but it too is buggy. As stated in our revised plan, we are putting all our focus on to the player to get that working correctly.
