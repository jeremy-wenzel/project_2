### How to Build the game

1. run command "./buildit". An error will be thrown stating the "CEGUI could not be found". This is fine as we aren't using it. 
2. just to be safe, run command "./makeit"
3. To run the game, run command "./assignment2"
4. BTW you probably want to turn your sound down. There is currently a bug where the player begins by starting on the ground which is causing the sound to go off and it is kinda loud.

### How to Play the game

The game, currently, isn't in a playable state because the Paddle hasn't been fully implemented. You can attempt to move forward using the "W" key but it is really buggy. You can also try to move the orientation of the paddle with the mouse but it too is buggy. As stated in our revised plan, we are putting all our focus on to the player to get that working correctly. Lastly, make sure your volume is down because it is kind of loud
